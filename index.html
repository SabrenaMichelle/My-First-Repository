        "Its not easy knowing what you want to be when you grow up, I just knew that I didn't want to wakeup to go to a tedious job where I was under paid and over worked. 
        My previous job in retail seemed to do more of the latter so when I was let go, I made the decision to never let that happen again, my next job will be used as a
         ladder to finding out what career I really want to be in. When the pandemic finally hit the U.S., it knocked me off the ladder but after being in a new job for 
         almost a year, I told myself to start looking into taking classes. After a month of searching through schools and trying to figure out which classes I wanted to 
         take, I saw a flyer at work advertising classes for Software Engineering. Suddenly I knew what I was going to do. Computers and technology had already fascinated 
        me and I remember being jealous of my 10 year old cousin learning code in elementary so when the oppurtunity came along to learn as well, I had to take it!"
